# Restaurant Client Website

##🔹 Description

Restaurant Client Website is a responsive front-end web application designed to represent the customer-facing side of a restaurant system. It focuses on showcasing the restaurant’s interface from a user perspective, including layout, design, and interaction flow.

This project helped me understand how client-side applications are structured and how users interact with restaurant platforms in real-world scenarios.
